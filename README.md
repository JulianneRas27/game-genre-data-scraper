## Purpose

The team conducted a research project to better understand the appropriateness
and sterotypical gendered nature of free online games. The team worked towards 
the research question: How appropriate and stereotypically gendered are the 
free online games directed towards children? The team used AI systems to rank 
the appropriateness of and observe the gender marketed differences of the game 
genres on the Girls Go Game website.
