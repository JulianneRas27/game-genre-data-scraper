    "\n",
    "> How appropriate and stereotypically gendered are free online games directed towards children?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The team shared personal experience of coming across unusal themed games on free large gaming websites at a young age. They recalled seeing many games with thumbnails of pregnant princesses, foot cleaning, tongue cleaning, mental breakdowns, and dramatic romantic scenarios. These types of games were marketed specifically towards girls by the use of often including \"girls\" in the website title. The concept led them to further wonder what similar marketed boy themed games consisted of."
